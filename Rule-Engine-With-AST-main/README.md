# Rule Engine with AST 

## Objective
Develop a simple 3-tier rule engine application (Simple UI, API, and Backend, Data) to determine user eligibility based on attributes like age, department, income, spend, etc. The system will utilize an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent conditional rules and will support dynamic creation, combination, and modification of these rules.

## Data Structure
Define a data structure to represent the AST. The structure should allow for rule changes. One possible data structure could be a Node with the following fields:
- `type`: String indicating the node type ("operator" for AND/OR, "operand" for conditions)
- `left`: Reference to another Node (left child)
- `right`: Reference to another Node (right child for operators)
- `value`: Optional value for operand nodes (e.g., number for comparisons)

## Data Storage
Use MongoDB for storing the rules and application metadata. Define the schema with sample data.

### Sample Rules
1. `rule1 = "((age > 30 AND department = 'Sales') OR (age < 25 AND department = 'Marketing')) AND (salary > 50000 OR experience > 5)"`
2. `rule2 = "((age > 30 AND department = 'Marketing')) AND (salary > 20000 OR experience > 5)"`

## API Design
1. `create_rule(rule_string)`: This function takes a string representing a rule (as shown in the examples) and returns a Node object representing the corresponding AST.
2. `combine_rules(rules)`: This function takes a list of rule strings and combines them into a single AST. It should consider efficiency and minimize redundant checks. The function should return the root node of the combined AST.
3. `evaluate_rule(data)`: This function takes a JSON object representing the combined rule's AST and a dictionary containing user attributes (e.g., `data = {"age": 35, "department": "Sales", "salary": 60000, "experience": 3}`). The function should evaluate the rule against the provided data and return `True` if the user meets the criteria based on the rule, `False` otherwise.

## Test Cases
1. Create individual rules from the examples using `create_rule` and verify their AST representation.
2. Combine the example rules using `combine_rules` and ensure the resulting AST reflects the combined logic.
3. Implement sample JSON data and test `evaluate_rule` for different scenarios.
4. Explore combining additional rules and test the functionality.

## Bonus
- Implement error handling for invalid rule strings or data formats (e.g., missing operators, invalid comparisons).
- Implement validations for attributes to be part of a catalog.
- Allow for modification of existing rules using additional functionalities within `create_rule` or separate functions. This could involve changing operators, operand values, or adding/removing sub-expressions within the AST.
- Consider extending the system to support user-defined functions within the rule language for advanced conditions (outside the scope of this exercise).

## Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the following command to clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

## Installation and Setup

### Backend
1. Navigate to the `rule-engine` directory.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file and add the necessary environment variables, including your database URL:
   ```plaintext
   MONGODB_URI=<your_database_url>
   ```
4. Start the backend server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the `rule-engine-frontend` directory.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the frontend development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the frontend application in your browser.
2. Use the UI to create, combine, and evaluate rules.
3. The backend API will handle rule creation, combination, and evaluation.

## API Key Formats

### Evaluate Rule Key Format
To evaluate a rule in Postman, use the following JSON format:
```json
{
  "ruleId": "66a27c89dca01ec0a644901e",
  "data": {
    "age": 40,
    "department": "Sales",
    "salary": 60000,
    "experience": 3
  }
}
```

### Create Rule and Combine Rule Format
To create or combine a rule in Postman, use the following JSON format:
```json
{
  "rule_string": "((age > 30 AND department = 'Sales') OR (age < 25 AND department = 'Marketing')) AND (salary > 50000 OR experience > 5)"
}
```

Make sure to install `node_modules` in both the frontend and backend directories by running `npm install` in each respective directory.
